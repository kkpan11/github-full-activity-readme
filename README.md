## Instructions

- Add the comment `<!--START_SECTION:activity-->` (entry point) within `README.md`. You can find an example [here](https://github.com/Pop101/Pop101/blob/master/README.md).

- It's the time to create a workflow file.

`.github/workflows/update-readme.yml`

```yml
name: Update README

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/30 * * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Update this repo's README with recent activity

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: Pop101/github-full-activity-readme@master
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

The above job runs every half an hour, you can change it as you wish based on the [cron syntax](https://jasonet.co/posts/scheduled-actions/#the-cron-syntax).

Most public events show up, including

- Commenting on Issues
- Opening and Closing Issues
- Opening Pull Requests
- Pushing to Repositories
- Forking Repositories
- Starring Repositories
- Repositories Creation and Publishing
